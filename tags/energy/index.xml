      <title>New paper in Nature Sustainability</title>

      <description>Nature Sustainability recently published our article on energy access and gender inequality (co-authored by Meital Rosenberg, Daniel Armanios, Paulina Jaramillo, and I). The question is simple: once a household gets access to electricity, who benefits from it? Many studies in the past have shown that electricity access benefits women (for instance on the labor market). We show that things are not that straightforward when we examine its effect on households.</description>

      <title>Two posts on off-grid electricity</title>

      <description>I wrote two posts for Power for All. They draw on new data from IRENA on off-grid renewable electricity capacity in emerging and developing countries. In short, these data show (a) that capacity has increased substantially over the last 10 years, (b) not all developing countries benefitted from it, and (c) the most successful countries seem to be mid-income ones.

      <description>Our book Escaping the Energy Poverty Trap (MIT Press), co-authored with Patrick Bayer, S.P. Harish, and Johannes Urpelainen, is now available in bookstores (MIT has links to several sellers; see here).
Here’s the blurb:
 The first comprehensive political science account of energy poverty, arguing that governments can improve energy access for their citizens through appropriate policy design.
  In today’s industrialized world, almost everything we do consumes energy.</description>

      <title>New publication: How robust is the renewable energy industry to political shocks?</title>
      <link>/news/2018-10-04-bap/</link>

      <description>I just published a new article in Business and Politics called “How robust is the renewable energy industry to political shocks? Evidence from the 2016 U.S. elections.” Ungated link here.
The short version: the renewable energy industry has grown a lot since the 2000s. Its development was made possible by pro-active governments, who invested in R&amp;amp;D, set targets, etc. The logic is similar to the infant industry argument: in the presence of market failures, some sectors need public support to expand.</description>

      <title>New article in The Print</title>

      <description>I wrote a short article in The Print comparing electrification rates in India with its neighbors. In short: India has been doing well, but so has the region in general. As India gets closer to universal electrification (and we aren’t there yet, despite good progress), the focus needs to shift to improving quality of electricity provision. This will require to make the public and private industries operating in this area more sustainable.</description>
