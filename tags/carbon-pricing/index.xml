My paper with Matto Mildenberger, “Prisoners of the Wrong Dilemma: Why Distributive Conflict, Not Collective Action, Characterizes the Politics of Climate Change,” is out at Global Environmental Politics. You can find an ungated pre-print here.

Patrick Bayer and I published a paper in PNAS (ungated) on the effectiveness of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). The EU ETS is one of the most ambitious attempts to put a price on carbon emissions. However, it has often been criticized as being too generous toward firms and therefore not having enough ‘bite.’ People often point at the ETS’ low permit prices as evidence for this.</description>
