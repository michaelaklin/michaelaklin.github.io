The Heinz Foundation will generously fund a project on the barriers and opportunities faced by US fossil fuel workers in the midst of the clean energy transition. Green jobs could offer promising alternative livelihoods, but whether these jobs will meet people’s needs is uncertain. Where will these jobs materialize? How much reskilling will be required? Are these jobs competitive? And perhaps most importantly: do they meet people’s aspirations?</description>

      <description>February 13, 2021
Two new papers came out in the last couple of weeks.
In the first, Kern, Negre, and I examine some of the side effects of central bank independence. We suspect that governments may respond to a loss of control over monetary policy (i.e. more independent central banks) with policies that are bad for inequality.

My paper with Matto Mildenberger, “Prisoners of the Wrong Dilemma: Why Distributive Conflict, Not Collective Action, Characterizes the Politics of Climate Change,” is out at Global Environmental Politics. You can find an ungated pre-print here.
Long story short: many argue that the main obstacle to effective climate policy is global free-riding. States are trapped in a prisoners’ dilemma, and we should put our effort into creating the kind of environment in which cooperation can be sustained.</description>

IISD just published a new report on electricity subsidies in India, with a focus on Jharkhand (written by Shruti Sharma, Tom Moerenhout, and myself). We show that electricity subsidies primarily benefit households that are wealthier. The report includes several alternative targetting options to ensure a more equal and just allocation of subsidies.
The report is available here: How to Target Residential Electricity Subsidies in India.

Patrick Bayer and I published a paper in PNAS (ungated) on the effectiveness of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). The EU ETS is one of the most ambitious attempts to put a price on carbon emissions. However, it has often been criticized as being too generous toward firms and therefore not having enough ‘bite.’ People often point at the ETS’ low permit prices as evidence for this.</description>
