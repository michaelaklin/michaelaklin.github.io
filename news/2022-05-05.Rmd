The Heinz Foundation will generously fund a project on the barriers and opportunities faced by US fossil fuel workers in the midst of the clean energy transition. Green jobs could offer promising alternative livelihoods, but whether these jobs will meet people's needs is uncertain. Where will these jobs materialize? How much reskilling will be required? Are these jobs competitive? And perhaps most importantly: do they meet people's aspirations?

This project is run jointly with [Morgan Frank](https://sites.pitt.edu/~mrfrank/).
